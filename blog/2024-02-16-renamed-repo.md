title: New repo URL

I renamed my GitLab username to something shorter and was happy to see that the pages domain names were updated automatically in just a moment. 

<!--truncate-->

Only for the base domain (username.gitlab.io) I had to also update the repository path under Settings -> General -> Advanced -> Change path to /newusername.gitlab.io.

Finally, I didn't face any issues with the deploy pipelines in the new namespace.
