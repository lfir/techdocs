All the existing documents are now integrated with Docusaurus v2 and offline usage (including search) is available through the PWA.

To install the PWA (Progressive web app) simply click on the install button that shows up in the URL bar while browsing the site.

Since the main features work well, I will continue using Docusaurus v2 exclusively for this website from now on.
