Started migrating the site to Docusaurus v2, which provides additional features such as offline search and dark mode.

<!--truncate-->

Hopefully it'll also make it easier to maintain in the long term and more secure since it uses newer libraries.

Stuff that still needs to be migrated and won't be available for a while:

- Most docs.
- Offline version.
- Disqus comments.
