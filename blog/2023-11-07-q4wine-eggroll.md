title: Using Q4Wine with wine-ge-custom and Proton

Lately [Q4Wine](https://github.com/brezerk/q4wine) has been my favorite Wine GUI since it's very
flexible and allows setting up and managing prefixes with specific configurations.
Also [wine-ge-custom](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom) is a custom build of Wine
based on [Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) meant to be used with
non-Steam games outside of Steam.

<!--truncate-->

To make a prefix use a certain Wine build first it needs to be added under
Tools -> Wine Version Manager

and after that is done in the Prefixes tab it can start being assigned to them.
