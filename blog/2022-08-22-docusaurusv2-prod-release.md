On August 1st Docusarus version 2.0 was launched, the first production release after several betas.
A few days later **Sci & Tech docs** was updated to start using it.

The update process from the beta 17 was pretty simple although some configuration options
were moved to a different file and some CSS styles seemed to work differently on certain
components, which required some additional small tweaks.
