I\'ve not faced any issues\\nin more than 10 major versions, and going from 40 to 42 was no exception. These are some tips that I\\nthink are important to maintain such level of continuity and stability:\\n\\n- Don\'t use programs from third-party repositories, except for [RPMFusion](https://rpmfusion.org).\\n  They might introduce conflicts with other packages or not provide versions for new Fedora\\n  releases on time. With so many apps nowadays on RPMFusion and Flatpak this is very easy to avoid.\\n- Keep **/** and **/home** in separate partitions. This way even if something goes wrong with the\\n  release upgrade you can reinstall from scratch without any damage to most of your configuration\\n  and personal files.\\n\\nCongratulations to Red Hat and the Fedora team and community!"},{"id":"/2024/03/05/docusaurusv3-update","metadata":{"permalink":"/techdocs/blog/2024/03/05/docusaurusv3-update","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-05-docusaurusv3-update.md","title":"Docusaurus

The process can be daunting and time-consuming for newcomers and even seasoned Linux users.\\n\\nThe Wine Application Database (AppDB) allows users to browse and submit test results, documenting how well each\\napplication runs under Wine and any tweaks that were needed to make it work. Contributing to the AppDB not only\\nhelps other users but also serves as a personal record for future reference. For example, my submissions include:\\n\\n- [Pirates of the burning sea](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=10687&iTestingId=89827) - A naval\\n  MMORPG that ran smoothly with the addition of a few dependencies.\\n- [Final Fantasy VIII](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=30894&iTestingId=86031) - PC port\\n  of the classic PS1 JRPG which also ran well with really simple adjustments.\\n- [UOSteam](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=34336&iTestingId=100963) - Mapping tool\\n  for the game Ultima Online. Only needed one small additional library to execute without issues.\\n\\nBy sharing these setups, I think I might\u2019ve helped others manage to replicate successful configurations while\\ncreating a reference for myself when installing a similar application, or the same program on a new machine.\\nThis can be especially useful since official support in my experience is usually very hard to get for particular problems."},{"id":"/2019/06/19/search-enabled","metadata":{"permalink":"/techdocs/blog/2019/06/19/search-enabled","source":"@site/blog/2019-06-19-search-enabled.md","title":"Search enabled","description":"Search service providad by","date":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Asta86","url":"https://maybelambda.cf","imageURL":"/techdocs/img/l-logo.png","key":"lea","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Search enabled","authors":"lea"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Wine Application Database","permalink":"/techdocs/blog/2019/12/27/wine-appdb"},"nextItem":{"title":"Migrate site to Docusaurus","permalink":"/techdocs/blog/2019/06/13/new-version-docusaurus"}},"content":"Search service providad by\\n[Algolia](https://github.com/algolia)\\nis now available.
